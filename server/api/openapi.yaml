            Specifies whether or not miimon should use MII or ETHTOOL ioctls vs. netif_carrier_ok() to determine the link status. The MII or ETHTOOL ioctls are less efficient and utilize a deprecated calling sequence within the kernel.  The netif_carrier_ok() relies on the device driver to maintain its state with netif_carrier_on/off; at this writing, most, but not all, device drivers support this facility.
            If bonding insists that the link is up when it should not be, it may be that your network device driver does not support netif_carrier_on/off.  The default state for netif_carrier is "carrier on," so if a driver does not support netif_carrier, it will appear as if the link is always up.  In this case, setting use_carrier to 0 will cause bonding to revert to the MII / ETHTOOL ioctl method to determine the link state.
            A value of 1 enables the use of netif_carrier_ok(), a value of 0 will use the deprecated MII / ETHTOOL ioctls.  The default value is 1.

        arp_interval:

            Specifies the ARP link monitoring frequency in milliseconds.
            The ARP monitor works by periodically checking the slave devices to determine whether they have sent or received traffic recently (the precise criteria depends upon the bonding mode, and the state of the slave).  Regular traffic is generated via ARP probes issued for the addresses specified by the arp_ip_target option.
            This behavior can be modified by the arp_validate option, below.
            If ARP monitoring is used in an etherchannel compatible mode (modes 0 and 2), the switch should be configured in a mode that evenly distributes packets across all links. If the switch is configured to distribute the packets in an XOR fashion, all replies from the ARP targets will be received on the same link which could cause the other team members to fail.  ARP monitoring should not be used in conjunction with miimon.  A value of 0 disables ARP monitoring.  The default value is 0.

            the failover, subsequent packets are sent in each 200ms interval.

            The valid range is 0 - 255; the default value is 1. A value of 0
            prevents the IGMP membership report from being issued in response
            to the failover event.

            This option is useful for bonding modes balance-rr (0), active-backup
            (1), balance-tlb (5) and balance-alb (6), in which a failover can
            switch the IGMP traffic from one slave to another.  Therefore a fresh
            IGMP report must be issued to cause the switch to forward the incoming
            IGMP traffic over the newly selected slave.

            This option was added for bonding version 3.7.0.

            The default behavior of tlb mode is to shuffle active flows across
            slaves based on the load in that interval. This gives nice lb
            characteristics but can cause packet reordering. If re-ordering is
            a concern use this variable to disable flow shuffling and rely on
            load balancing provided solely by the hash distribution.
            xmit-hash-policy can be used to select the appropriate hashing for
            the setup.

            This delay should be a multiple of the link monitor interval

          description: |-
            Specifies whether or not miimon should use MII or ETHTOOL ioctls vs. netif_carrier_ok() to determine the link status. The MII or ETHTOOL ioctls are less efficient and utilize a deprecated calling sequence within the kernel.  The netif_carrier_ok() relies on the device driver to maintain its state with netif_carrier_on/off; at this writing, most, but not all, device drivers support this facility.
            If bonding insists that the link is up when it should not be, it may be that your network device driver does not support netif_carrier_on/off.  The default state for netif_carrier is "carrier on," so if a driver does not support netif_carrier, it will appear as if the link is always up.  In this case, setting use_carrier to 0 will cause bonding to revert to the MII / ETHTOOL ioctl method to determine the link state.
            A value of 1 enables the use of netif_carrier_ok(), a value of 0 will use the deprecated MII / ETHTOOL ioctls.  The default value is 1.

        arp_interval:
          description: |
            Specifies the ARP link monitoring frequency in milliseconds.
            The ARP monitor works by periodically checking the slave devices to determine whether they have sent or received traffic recently (the precise criteria depends upon the bonding mode, and the state of the slave).  Regular traffic is generated via ARP probes issued for the addresses specified by the arp_ip_target option.
            This behavior can be modified by the arp_validate option, below.
            If ARP monitoring is used in an etherchannel compatible mode (modes 0 and 2), the switch should be configured in a mode that evenly distributes packets across all links. If the switch is configured to distribute the packets in an XOR fashion, all replies from the ARP targets will be received on the same link which could cause the other team members to fail.  ARP monitoring should not be used in conjunction with miimon.  A value of 0 disables ARP monitoring.  The default value is 0.

            the failover, subsequent packets are sent in each 200ms interval.

            The valid range is 0 - 255; the default value is 1. A value of 0
            prevents the IGMP membership report from being issued in response
            to the failover event.

            This option is useful for bonding modes balance-rr (0), active-backup
            (1), balance-tlb (5) and balance-alb (6), in which a failover can
            switch the IGMP traffic from one slave to another.  Therefore a fresh
            IGMP report must be issued to cause the switch to forward the incoming
            IGMP traffic over the newly selected slave.

Newer versions allow selection of additional policies based on IP addresses (layer2+3) and TCP/UDP port numbers (layer3+4). This selects the same NIC slave for each destination MAC address, IP address, or IP address and port combination, respectively. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation. The bonding driver intercepts the ARP Replies sent by the local system on their way out and overwrites the source hardware address with the unique hardware address of one of the NIC slaves in the single logical bonded interface such that different network-peers use different MAC addresses for their network packet traffic.

    info_data_bond_primary_reselect:
      description: |
        Specifies the reselection policy for the primary slave.  This affects how the primary slave is chosen to become the active slave when failure of the active slave or recovery of the primary slave occurs.  This option is designed to prevent flip-flopping between the primary slave and other slaves.  Possible values are:

          * `always` - or 0 (default)
            The primary slave becomes the active slave whenever it
            comes back up.
          * `better` - or 1
            The primary slave becomes the active slave when it comes
            back up, if the speed and duplex of the primary slave is
            better than the speed and duplex of the current active
            slave.
          * `failure` - or 2
            The primary slave becomes the active slave only if the
            current active slave fails and the primary slave is up.

        The primary_reselect setting is ignored in two cases:

          * If no slaves are active, the first slave to recover is
            made the active slave.

          * When initially enslaved, the primary slave is always made
            the active slave.

        Changing the primary_reselect policy via sysfs will cause an immediate selection of the best active slave according to the new policy.  This may or may not result in a change of the active slave, depending upon the circumstances.
        This option was added for bonding version 3.6.0.

    info_data_bond_fail_over_mac:
      description: |
        Specifies whether active-backup mode should set all slaves to the same MAC address at enslavement (the traditional behavior), or, when enabled, perform special handling of the bond's MAC address in accordance with the selected policy. The default policy is none, unless the first slave cannot change its MAC address, in which case the active policy is selected by default. This option may be modified via sysfs only when no slaves are present in the bond. This option was added in bonding version 3.2.0.  The "follow" policy was added in bonding version 3.3.0. Possible values are:
          * `none` - or 0
          This setting disables fail_over_mac, and causes
          bonding to set all slaves of an active-backup bond to
          the same MAC address at enslavement time.  This is the
          default.
          * `active` - or 1
          The "active" fail_over_mac policy indicates that the
          MAC address of the bond should always be the MAC
          address of the currently active slave.  The MAC
          address of the slaves is not changed; instead, the MAC
          address of the bond changes during a failover.
          This policy is useful for devices that cannot ever
          alter their MAC address, or for devices that refuse
          incoming broadcasts with their own source MAC (which
          interferes with the ARP monitor).
          The down side of this policy is that every device on
          the network must be updated via gratuitous ARP,
          vs. just updating a switch or set of switches (which
          often takes place for any traffic, not just ARP
          traffic, if the switch snoops incoming traffic to
          update its tables) for the traditional method.  If the
          gratuitous ARP is lost, communication may be
          disrupted.
          When this policy is used in conjunction with the mii
          monitor, devices which assert link up prior to being
          able to actually transmit and receive are particularly
          susceptible to loss of the gratuitous ARP, and an
          appropriate updelay setting may be required.
          * `follow` - or 2
          The "follow" fail_over_mac policy causes the MAC
          address of the bond to be selected normally (normally
          the MAC address of the first slave added to the bond).
          However, the second and subsequent slaves are not set
          to this MAC address while they are in a backup role; a
          slave is programmed with the bond's MAC address at
          failover time (and the formerly active slave receives
          the newly active slave's MAC address).
          This policy is useful for multiport devices that
          either become confused or incur a performance penalty
          when multiple ports are programmed with the same MAC
          address.

        The valid range is 0 - 255; the default value is 1. A value of 0
        prevents the IGMP membership report from being issued in response
        to the failover event.

        This option is useful for bonding modes balance-rr (0), active-backup
        (1), balance-tlb (5) and balance-alb (6), in which a failover can
        switch the IGMP traffic from one slave to another.  Therefore a fresh
        IGMP report must be issued to cause the switch to forward the incoming
        IGMP traffic over the newly selected slave.

    info_data_bond_min_links:
      description: |
        Specifies the minimum number of links that must be active before

        feature. This allows setting the minimum number of member ports that
        must be up (link-up state) before marking the bond device as up
        (carrier on). This is useful for situations where higher level services
        such as clustering want to ensure a minimum number of low bandwidth
        links are active before switchover. This option only affect 802.3ad
        mode.

        The default value is 0. This will cause carrier to be asserted (for
        802.3ad mode) whenever there is an active aggregator, regardless of the
        number of available links in that aggregator. Note that, because an
        aggregator cannot be active without at least one available link,

    info_data_bond_tlb_dynamic_lb:
      description: |
        Specifies if dynamic shuffling of flows is enabled in tlb
        mode. The value has no effect on any other modes.

        The default behavior of tlb mode is to shuffle active flows across
        slaves based on the load in that interval. This gives nice lb
        characteristics but can cause packet reordering. If re-ordering is
        a concern use this variable to disable flow shuffling and rely on
        load balancing provided solely by the hash distribution.
        xmit-hash-policy can be used to select the appropriate hashing for
        the setup.

        The sysfs entry can be used to change the setting per bond device
        and the initial value is derived from the module parameter. The
        sysfs entry is allowed to be changed only if the bond device is
        down.

        The default value is "1" that enables flow shuffling while value "0"
        disables it. This option was added in bonding driver 3.7.1
      example: 1
